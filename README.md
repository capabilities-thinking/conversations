# Capabilities Thinking
This is a repository for helping drive a conversation around capabilities thinking, building on the work of the community to help stir up new ideas about how we build and integrate software. The goal here is to build upon each other's ideas and existing work to produce work that moves the capabilities discussion forward.

## What is capability thinking?

"Capability Thinking reframes the unit of design. Instead of exposing granular resources, platforms describe discrete business functions such as Ship Order, Process Payment, or Approve Loan." - Daniel Kocot

## What is a capability?

- "The power or ability to do something." - Dictionary Definition
- "The extent of someone's or something's ability." - Dictionary Definition
- "Capabilities are open-source, declarative, standards-based integrations that are aligned with business outcomes within specific domains, providing what is needed to deliver and automate integrations across a variety of use cases." - Kin Lane
- "Think of a 'capability' as a self-describing, semantically rich declaration of what a system can do, not just how to invoke it." - Christian Posta

## What are the properties of a capability?

- **Intuitive Metadata** - A simple title, description, and tags of what a capability does.
- **Business Aligned** - A capability speaks to business outcomes and not system design.
- **Stakeholders** - Capabilities possess product, engineering, and domain stakeholders.
- **Domain-Driven** - Capabilities use a common language to align engineering with business.
- **Clear Boundaries** - Capabilities possess clear separations of concern for what they do.
- **Integrated** - Capabilities integrate across API, data connection, or file system.
- **Interoperable** - Capabilities should natively work together with other capabilities.
- **Human-Readable** - A capability is something any person can easily read and understand.
- **Machine-Readable** - A capability is something that any machine can input or output.
- **Reusable** - Capabilities are designed to be modular and reused in multiple ways.
- **Composable** - Capabilities can be composite and a mix of multiple capabilities.
- **Declarative** - Capabilities should be declarative in any engine they are configuring.
- **Discoverable** - Capabilities possess rich metadata that always enables discovery.
- **Inputs and Outputs** - Capabilities have what is needed as input and available as output.
- **Virtualized** - Capabilities have usable examples, presets, data, and configurations.
- **Event-Driven** - Capabilities natively can respond to and trigger common events.
- **Automated** - Capabilities can be automated via scheduling, events, and pipelines.
- **Predictable** - When automated, capabilities provide repeatable building blocks.
- **Communicated** - Capabilities communicate with stakeholders via existing channels.
- **Multi-Modal** - Capabilities are able to work across multiple needed media types.
- **Multi-Protocol** - Capabilities are able to work natively across needed protocols.
- **Collaborative** - Capabilities drive collaborative behavior amongst stakeholders.
- **Governed** - Capabilities are governed as part of regular delivery and usage.
- **Policy-Driven** - Capabilities are configured globally using common policy rules.
- **Mature** - Capabilities need to have a maturity model to understand development.
- **Monitored** - Capabilities are monitored from multiple dimensions and regions.
- **Observable** - Capabilities are able to be observed via existing observability systems.
- **Traceable** - The fingerprints of a capability should be anywhere it is used.
- **Authenticated** - Capabilities have the keys they need to access systems and tools.
- **Role-Based** - Capabilities are shaped based upon a specific role and the access it is given.
- **Secured** - Capabilities make security a priority as part of design and implementation.
- **Executable** - Capabilities are an executable unit of business value in a container.
- **Shareable** - Capabilities are easily shared using native capabilities where found.
- **Lifecycle** - Capabilities possess a known, clear, and communicated lifecycle.
- **Orchestrated** - Capabilities orchestrate across multiple services and tooling.
- **Transformed** - Capabilities enable the reliable transformation of data.
- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** - Capabilities define their total cost of ownership.
- **Value Exchanges** - Capabilities enable monetization and defining of value exchanged.
- **Standards-Driven** - Capabilities build on existing standards in use by companies.
- **Semantics** - Capabilities possess the semantics required to understand what they do.
- **Guided** - Capabilities should educate and inform stakeholders in all interactions.
- **Insights** - Capabilities provide insights into how they are working or not working.
- **Documented** - Capabilities are always documented, sharing exactly what they do.

## Relevant Quotes

- "In automation, capabilities become predictable building blocks." - Daniel Kocot
- "In collaboration, business teams can reason about capabilities directly." - Daniel Kocot
- "In event-driven designs, capabilities naturally connect to events." - Daniel Kocot
- "For AI agents, capabilities are easier to navigate." - Daniel Kocot
- "As ecosystems expand and automation becomes more common, being able to articulate a platform's capabilities clearly will determine how well it can adapt. Moving from APIs to capabilities is not just a shift in terminology. It is a step toward making digital platforms more meaningful and resilient." - Daniel Kocot
- "Instead of exposing APIs and contracts, we need systems to expose capabilities." - Christian Posta
- "The first step in breaking the data-centric habit is to stop designing systems as a collection of data services, and instead design for business capabilities." - Irakli Nadareishvili
- "When the client is autonomous, your API has to be more than a list of endpoints. Instead, it needs to be a menu of possibilities." - Mike Amundsen
- "The most important thing about APIs is not their operations. At least, not for potential API consumers. The thing they value the most is understanding what capabilities an API offers. And, by capabilities, I mean the things that make people's lives easier." - Bruno Pedro
